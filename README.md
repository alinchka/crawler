# crawler
Web crawler to download webpages
Python 3 + PyCharm
For the program to work correctly, we need to install the following packages:
requests: A library for executing HTTP requests. It allows you to send requests to websites and receive responses.
BeautifulSoup: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It helps to extract data from web pages.
urljoin: A function from the urllib.parse module that is used to connect the base URL with relative links to get absolute URLs.
